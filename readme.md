simplified rewrite of [avers](https://github.com/wereHamster/avers) in Rust:

- only supporting [all-o-stasis-avers](https://github.com/iff/all-o-stasis-avers) atm
- merged most of the api/http crates into a specific binary
- using firestore
- object types currently hardcoded to be boulders or accounts
- no releases, no websockets (feed), ...
